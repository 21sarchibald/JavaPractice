# Finance Tracker in Java

Finance tracker program that uses 3 classes: FinanceTracker, Account, and Transactions. Allows users to add a new transaction including the date, amount, and description of the transaction. The program adds each transaction to an ArrayList in Java, and then the transactions are written to a csv file for storage. The user can view their account balance, which is calculated by accessing the amount attribute of each transaction and adding them together. The user can also view all past transactions, which the program formats after looping through each item in the csv file, extracting attributes from each transaction, then outputting the attributes in a clean format.
